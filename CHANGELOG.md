## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Foundation: `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes` (LF normalize, `.meta` → `unityyamlmerge`).
- Foundation: `AGENTS.md` (local agent governance, do/don't rules, sibling package consumers).
- Foundation: `CLAUDE.md` (Claude-specific entry point mirroring the McpKit stack template).
- Foundation: `SECURITY.md` (private disclosure via GitHub Security Advisories, response targets).
- Foundation: `CODEOWNERS` (default reviewer: `@KooshaPari`).
- Foundation: `.github/workflows/dotnet-test.yml` (Ubuntu, .NET 8, runs the existing xunit test project `tests/phenotype-water.tests.csproj`).
- Foundation: `.github/dependabot.yml` (weekly updates for `github-actions` and `nuget`, 5-PR limit).
- Foundation: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` and `feature_request.md`.
- Foundation: `.github/pull_request_template.md` (summary, type-of-change checklist, affected surface, testing checklist, spec/traceability, risks, related).
- Foundation: `CONTRIBUTING.md` (AgilePlus spec mandate, dotnet build + dotnet test commands, kebab-case branch conventions, Conventional Commits, PR expectations with explicit backward-compatible public-API rule and the "changes to the unsafe path must come with a test" rule).
- Docs: expand `README.md` to mirror the phenotype-terrain layout — Build section with the `WorldBoxManaged` env var and `dotnet build`/`dotnet test`, Consuming section with the project-reference XML and a note that `tests/phenotype-water.tests.csproj` is not a consumer dependency, and License pointing at the in-repo `LICENSE`.
